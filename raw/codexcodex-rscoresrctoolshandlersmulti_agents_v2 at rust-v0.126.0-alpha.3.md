**Codex CLI** is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer.

If you want Codex in your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), [install in your IDE.](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide)  
If you want the desktop app experience, run `codex app` or visit [the Codex App page](https://chatgpt.com/codex?app-landing-page=true).  
If you are looking for the *cloud-based agent* from OpenAI, **Codex Web**, go to [chatgpt.com/codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex).

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```
```
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

You can also go to the [latest GitHub Release](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest) and download the appropriate binary for your platform.

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
	- Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
		- x86\_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
	- x86\_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
		- arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).
