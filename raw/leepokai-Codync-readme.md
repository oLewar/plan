Codync turns the coding agents on your computer — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Pi, OpenCode, Grok Build, Gemini, Copilot and ~40 more — into persistent *bots* you delegate to from your iPhone, Mac, Linux desktop or any terminal, the way you'd message a colleague. Pick who, say what, put the phone away. You get a notification when a bot finishes or needs your approval.

> Why bots? On a phone, "find the right working session, then pick an environment" is too slow. With bots you already know who to hand the intent to: open the chat, type, done.

## Why Codync

- **Free and open source.** No subscription, no paid tier, MIT licensed. It runs on your computer with the agents and accounts you already have.
- **Bring any coding agent.** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, Pi, Grok Build and ~40 more — everything in the [ACP registry](https://agentclientprotocol.com/registry). Installed agents are found automatically, the rest are fetched on first use, and every bot picks its own. Mix them freely: a Claude bot can ask a Codex bot for a review.
- **Many bots, one team.** Run as many bots as you like side by side, each with its own agent, project folder and approvals, all working at once. Put several in a **group chat** and they answer in turn, like a team channel; `@name` picks who replies. Start a **thread** on any message to branch off without cluttering the main chat.
- **Built in Rust.** `codync-host` is one small, fast Rust binary for macOS and Linux (static on Linux, runs on any distro) that drives every agent, keeps the transcripts and serves every client.
- **Native on every platform.** SwiftUI on iPhone and Mac, GTK 4 / libadwaita on Linux, and a terminal UI for SSH. No web views, no Electron.
- **A 1:1 Grok Bot / Muse alternative.** Persistent named bots, group chats, reply threads, bots asking each other for help, approval cards, per-bot memory, remote screen, voice calls and "needs you / done" notifications — the same features, without being tied to one model or one subscription.
- **Reach your computer from anywhere, free.** The hosted Cloudflare relay is included at no cost: no Tailscale, no VPN, no port forwarding. Traffic is end-to-end encrypted between your phone and your computer, so the relay only forwards ciphertext. Same Wi-Fi or Tailscale? The phone connects directly instead.
- **Every computer, one app.** Sign in and your iPhone lists every computer on your account (Mac, Linux desktop, server or cloud VM); tap **Connect**, confirm a 6-digit code on that computer, and its bots show up next to the others. A new bot can live on any of them, and the Mac app reaches your SSH machines too. Each computer approves each device itself, so an account alone never unlocks a computer.
- **Remote screen.** See and control your computer from the iPhone over WebRTC (hardware H.264), and let bots use the screen themselves through the built-in `computer` tool.
- **Voice calls.** Talk to a bot hands-free from the iPhone and hear its replies read aloud.
- **Private push.** Notification text is sealed to your phone's key, so the push relay never sees what your bots said.

## Platforms

| | Platform | App | Highlights |
|---|---|---|---|
| 📱 | **iPhone** | Native SwiftUI | Chat with bots, approvals, push notifications, Live Activity, widgets, remote screen, voice calls |
| 💻 | **macOS** | Native SwiftUI, menu bar + window | Runs the host, chat window, usage in the menu bar, iPhone pairing |
| 🐧 | **Linux** | Native GTK 4 / libadwaita | Runs the host (desktop or headless server), chat app |
| ⌨️ | **Terminal** | `codync-host tui` | Message your bots from any terminal, over SSH too |

The host (`codync-host`, Rust) runs on macOS and Linux; every client talks to it, so all your bots and chats are the same everywhere.

## How it works

```text
Remote Apple client ⇄ encrypted channel (direct or Cloudflare cloud/) ⇄ codync-host ⇄ ACP agent
Local / SSH client  ⇄ loopback HTTP + SSE                             ⇄ codync-host
Host notifications → APNs worker (relay/) → iPhone
```

- **Bots** have a name, a character avatar, standing instructions, an agent backend, a project folder and a permission policy. Each bot has **a persistent main chat and optional reply threads**; the agent sessions underneath are an implementation detail (resumed with `session/load`, restarted with *New session*).
- **Group chats** hold several bots and you. Each message starts a short room turn: the bots you @-mention (or everyone) reply one at a time, each in its own session, and can react to each other, up to 3 rounds. See [group chats and threads](docs/features/groups-and-threads.md).
- **Bots can ask each other for help.** Tell one “ask Reviewer to check these changes.” The built-in `team` MCP server lets it discover your other visible bots and wait for a reply. Requests appear in both chats; each recipient keeps its own agent, folder and approvals. Native subagents stay under the coding agent's control. See [bot collaboration](docs/features/bot-collaboration.md).
- **The chat only shows what matters**: your messages, each turn's final reply, approval cards and notices. Every tool call, diff, plan and thought is one tap away in *Full conversation*. While a bot works, its row shows what it's doing right now.
- **Agents are detected automatically**: the host hydrates PATH from your login shell (plus Homebrew, ~/.local/bin, nvm, bun, volta, asdf, mise, pnpm…), finds every harness you have installed, and prefers its native ACP mode. Anything else in the official [ACP registry](https://agentclientprotocol.com/registry) can be picked too — Codync fetches it on first use (npx, uvx or a checksummed binary).
- **codync-host** (Rust, macOS + Linux) runs on your computer. It speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) to each agent, keeps transcripts in SQLite, and serves the phone. Every change carries a global `rev`, so the phone reconnects with `since: rev` and never misses anything.
- **Usage limits** come from your local installs, with no extra login: Claude via `claude -p /usage` (a local command, no model call) plus Claude Code's status line, Codex via `~/.codex/sessions`. The phone, widgets and menu bar only see percentages.
- **Push** goes through a tiny relay that holds the APNs key. The phone trades its device token for an encrypted ticket; the host only ever holds tickets.

UI patterns (roster, character avatars, approval cards, trace sheet, "needs you / done" notifications) follow Grok Bot.

## Install

**One line** (macOS or Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leepokai/Codync/main/packaging/install.sh | sh
```

On a Mac it installs the app (the host ships inside it); on Linux the host, plus the desktop app when a display is present. Add `sh -s -- --host-only` for servers and headless Macs. Re-run it to upgrade.

**Mac** — [download codync-macos.dmg](https://github.com/leepokai/Codync/releases/latest/download/codync-macos.dmg) and drag it to Applications, or:

```bash
brew install --cask leepokai/codync/codync
```

All three install the same signed, notarized app.

Open Codync: it sets up the host on first launch. **Open Codync** opens the full window; **Pair iPhone…** shows the QR code.

**iPhone** — [get Codync on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/codync/id6760984418) (iOS 18+, free), then scan the QR code from **Pair iPhone…** on the Mac, the Linux app or `codync-host pair`.

**Linux** — the host, plus the native GTK 4 / libadwaita app:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leepokai/Codync/main/packaging/install.sh | sh
# or: brew install leepokai/codync/codync-host
codync-host install   # systemd --user service
codync-host pair      # QR code in the terminal, or Settings in the app
```

The script also installs the desktop app (`codync`, with its `.desktop` file and icon) when you're in a graphical session; it needs GTK 4 and libadwaita. By hand: unpack `codync-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` from [Releases](https://github.com/leepokai/Codync/releases/latest) and run `bin/codync`.

Building the Linux app yourself needs `libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev`: `cargo install --path apps/linux`.

**Linux server / cloud VM** — the host runs headless on any distro (static binary, x86_64 + arm64). Setup, remote access and limitations: [docs/guides/linux-servers.md](docs/guides/linux-servers.md).

**Remote access** works out of the box through the free Cloudflare relay, end-to-end encrypted; the phone switches to a direct connection on the same network or over Tailscale. Details: [remote relay](docs/reference/remote-relay.md).

**Agents** — install and sign in to whichever you use; Codync finds them. Claude Code, Codex and Pi run through their ACP adapters (fetched by `npx`, so Node.js is needed for those).

`codync-host install` also routes Claude Code's status line through `codync-host statusline` so live limits reach the host; an existing status line keeps working (it's wrapped, and restored on `uninstall`).

## `codync-host`

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `codync-host install` / `uninstall` | background service (launchd on macOS, systemd `--user` on Linux) |
| `codync-host tui [--url … --token …]` | message your bots from a terminal (this computer by default; SSH-friendly) |
| `codync-host pair [--json]` | pairing QR code / link |
| `codync-host status` | installed? running? |
| `codync-host serve [--port 19222]` | run in the foreground |
| `codync-host statusline [-- <your command>]` | Claude Code status line command (wraps yours) |
| `codync-host reset-token` | rotate the local loopback bearer token |
| `codync-host cloud` | cloud enablement, URL and status |
| `codync-host devices` | list/revoke authorized remote devices |
| `codync-host access` | review device access requests |

Data lives in `~/.codync`. The local bearer token authorizes loopback helpers and SSH-forwarded callers. Remote devices use individual keys and grants over the encrypted channel; revoke a lost device through device management rather than rotating the loopback token. Host methods and caller permissions live in `host/src/api/mod.rs`.
