## oh — OpenHarness & ohmo

[**English**](https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/blob/main/README.md) · [**简体中文**](https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/blob/main/README.zh-CN.md)

**OpenHarness** delivers core lightweight agent infrastructure: tool-use, skills, memory, and multi-agent coordination.

**ohmo** is a personal AI agent built on OpenHarness — not another chatbot, but an assistant that actually works for you over long sessions. Chat with ohmo in Feishu / Slack / Telegram / Discord, and it forks branches, writes code, runs tests, and opens PRs on its own. ohmo runs on your existing Claude Code or Codex subscription — no extra API key needed.

**Join the community**: contribute **Harness** for open agent development.

One Command (**oh**) to Launch **OpenHarness** and Unlock All Agent Harnesses.

Supports CLI agent integration including OpenClaw, nanobot, Cursor, and more.

## 🤔 What is an Agent Harness?

An **Agent Harness** is the complete infrastructure that wraps around an LLM to make it a functional agent. The model provides intelligence; the harness provides **hands, eyes, memory, and safety boundaries**.

[![Harness = Tools + Knowledge + Observation + Action + Permissions](../assets/external/github.com/710de36eba7f76bb.png)](https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/blob/main/assets/harness-equation.png)

OpenHarness is an open-source Python implementation designed for **researchers, builders, and the community**:

- **Understand** how production AI agents work under the hood
- **Experiment** with cutting-edge tools, skills, and agent coordination patterns
- **Extend** the harness with custom plugins, providers, and domain knowledge
- **Build** specialized agents on top of proven architecture

---

## 📰 What's New

- **Unreleased** 🔍 **Dry-run safe preview**:
	- `oh --dry-run` previews resolved runtime settings, auth state, skills, commands, tools, and configured MCP servers without executing the model, tools, or subagents.
		- Dry-run now reports a `ready` / `warning` / `blocked` readiness verdict with concrete next-step suggestions such as fixing auth, fixing MCP config, or running the prompt directly.
		- Prompt previews include likely matching skills and tools, while slash-command previews show whether the command is mostly read-only or stateful.
- **2026-04-18** ⚙️ **v0.1.7** — Packaging & TUI polish:
	- Install script now links `oh`, `ohmo`, and `openharness` into `~/.local/bin` instead of prepending the virtualenv `bin` directory to `PATH`, which avoids clobbering Conda-managed shells.
		- React TUI now supports `Shift+Enter` to insert a newline while keeping plain `Enter` as submit.
		- Busy-state animation in the React TUI is quieter and less error-prone on Windows terminals, with conservative spinner frames and reduced flashing.
- **2026-04-10** 🧠 **v0.1.6** — Auto-Compaction & Markdown TUI:
	- Auto-Compaction preserves task state and channel logs across context compression — agents can run multi-day sessions without manual compact/clear
		- Subprocess teammates run in headless worker mode; agent team creation stabilized
		- Assistant messages now render full Markdown in the React TUI
		- `ohmo` gains channel slash commands and multimodal attachment support
- **2026-04-08** 🔌 **v0.1.5** — MCP HTTP transport & Swarm polling:
	- MCP protocol adds HTTP transport, auto-reconnect on disconnect, and tool-only server compatibility
		- JSON Schema types inferred for MCP tool inputs — no manual type mapping needed
		- `ohmo` channels support file attachments and multimodal gateway messages
		- Subprocess agents are now pollable in real runs; permission modals serialized to prevent input swallowing
- **2026-04-08** 🌙 **v0.1.4** — Multi-provider auth & Moonshot/Kimi:
	- Native Moonshot/Kimi provider with `reasoning_content` support for thinking models
		- Auth overhaul: fixed provider-switching key mismatch, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env override, profile-scoped credential priority
		- MCP gracefully handles disconnected servers in `call_tool` / `read_resource`
		- Security: built-in sensitive-path protection in PermissionChecker, hardened `web_fetch` URL validation
		- Stability: EIO crash recovery in Ink TUI, `--debug` logging, Windows cmd flash fix
- **2026-04-06** 🚀 **v0.1.2** — Unified setup flows and `ohmo` personal-agent app:
	- `oh setup` now guides provider selection as workflows instead of exposing raw auth/provider internals
		- Compatible API setup is now profile-scoped, so Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible endpoints can keep separate keys
		- `ohmo` ships as a packaged app with `~/.ohmo` workspace, gateway, bootstrap prompts, and channel config flow
- **2026-04-01** 🎨 **v0.1.0** — Initial **OpenHarness** open-source release featuring complete Harness architecture:

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1\. Install

#### Linux / macOS / WSL

```
# One-click install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Or via pip
pip install openharness-ai
```

#### Windows (Native)

```
# One-click install (PowerShell)
iex (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/main/scripts/install.ps1')

# Or via pip
pip install openharness-ai
```

**Note**: Windows support is now native. In PowerShell, use `openh` instead of `oh` because `oh` can resolve to the built-in `Out-Host` alias.

### 2\. Configure

```
oh setup    # interactive wizard — pick a provider, authenticate, done
# On Windows PowerShell, use: openh setup
```

Supports **Claude / OpenAI / Copilot / Codex / Moonshot(Kimi) / GLM / MiniMax** and any compatible endpoint.

### 3\. Run

```
oh
# On Windows PowerShell, use: openh
```

[![OpenHarness Landing Screen](../assets/external/github.com/c37c59465e45c382.png)](https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/blob/main/assets/landing.png)

### 4\. Set up ohmo (Personal Agent)

Want an AI agent that works for you from Feishu / Slack / Telegram / Discord?

```
ohmo init             # initialize ~/.ohmo workspace
ohmo config           # configure channels and provider
ohmo gateway start    # start the gateway — ohmo is now live in your chat app
```

ohmo runs on your existing **Claude Code subscription** or **Codex subscription** — no extra API key needed.

### Non-Interactive Mode (Pipes & Scripts)

```
# Single prompt → stdout
oh -p "Explain this codebase"

# JSON output for programmatic use
oh -p "List all functions in main.py" --output-format json

# Stream JSON events in real-time
oh -p "Fix the bug" --output-format stream-json
```

### Dry Run (Safe Preview)

Use `--dry-run` when you want to inspect what OpenHarness would use before any live execution starts.

```
# Preview an interactive session setup
oh --dry-run

# Preview one prompt without executing the model or tools
oh --dry-run -p "Review this bug fix and grep for failing tests"

# Preview a slash command path
oh --dry-run -p "/plugin list"

# Get structured output for scripts or channels
oh --dry-run -p "Explain this repository" --output-format json
```

Dry-run is intentionally static:

- It does **not** call the model
- It does **not** execute tools or spawn subagents
- It does **not** connect to MCP servers
- It **does** resolve settings, auth status, prompt assembly, skills, commands, tools, and obvious MCP config problems

Readiness levels:

- `ready`: configuration looks usable; the next suggested action is usually to run the prompt directly
- `warning`: OpenHarness can resolve the session, but something important still looks wrong, such as broken MCP config or missing auth for later model work
- `blocked`: the requested path will not run successfully as-is, for example an unknown slash command or a prompt that cannot resolve a runtime client

`next actions` in the dry-run output tell you the shortest fix or follow-up step, such as:

- run `oh auth login`
- fix or disable broken MCP configuration
- run the prompt directly with `oh -p "..."` or open the interactive UI with `oh`

## 🔌 Provider Compatibility

OpenHarness treats providers as **workflows** backed by named profiles. In day-to-day use, prefer:

```
oh setup
oh provider list
oh provider use <profile>
```

### Built-in Workflows

| Workflow | What it is | Typical backends |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anthropic-Compatible API** | Anthropic-style request format | Claude official, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, internal Anthropic-compatible gateways |
| **Claude Subscription** | Claude CLI subscription bridge | Local `~/.claude/.credentials.json` |
| **OpenAI-Compatible API** | OpenAI-style request format | OpenAI official, OpenRouter, DashScope, DeepSeek, SiliconFlow, Groq, Ollama, GitHub Models |
| **Codex Subscription** | Codex CLI subscription bridge | Local `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Copilot OAuth workflow | GitHub Copilot device-flow login |

### Compatible API Families

#### Anthropic-Compatible API

Typical examples:

| Backend | Base URL | Example models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude official** | `https://api.anthropic.com` | `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-6` |
| **Moonshot / Kimi** | `https://api.moonshot.cn/anthropic` | `kimi-k2.5` |
| **Zhipu / GLM** | custom Anthropic-compatible endpoint | `glm-4.5` |
| **MiniMax** | custom Anthropic-compatible endpoint | `minimax-m1` |

#### OpenAI-Compatible API

Any provider implementing the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` style API works:

| Backend | Base URL | Example models |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OpenAI** | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-4.1` |
| **OpenRouter** | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | provider-specific |
| **Alibaba DashScope** | `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` | `qwen3.5-flash`, `qwen3-max`, `deepseek-r1` |
| **DeepSeek** | `https://api.deepseek.com` | `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner` |
| **GitHub Models** | `https://models.inference.ai.azure.com` | `gpt-4o`, `Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct` |
| **SiliconFlow** | `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1` | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3` |
| **Google Gemini** | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` | `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro` |
| **Groq** | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| **Ollama (local)** | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | any local model |

### Advanced Profile Management

```
# List saved workflows
oh provider list

# Switch the active workflow
oh provider use codex

# Add your own compatible endpoint
oh provider add my-endpoint \
  --label "My Endpoint" \
  --provider openai \
  --api-format openai \
  --auth-source openai_api_key \
  --model my-model \
  --base-url https://example.com/v1
```

For custom compatible endpoints, OpenHarness can bind credentials per profile instead of forcing every Anthropic-compatible or OpenAI-compatible backend to share the same API key.

### Ollama (Local Models)

Run local models through Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```
# Add an Ollama provider profile
oh provider add ollama \
  --label "Ollama" \
  --provider Ollama \
  --api-format openai \
  --auth-source openai_api_key \
  --model glm-4.7-flash:q8_0 \
  --base-url http://localhost:11434/v1
```

```
Saved provider profile: ollama
```

```
# Activate and verify
oh provider use ollama
```

```
Activated provider profile: ollama
```

```
oh provider list
```

```
claude-api: Anthropic-Compatible API [ready]
  ...
  moonshot: Moonshot (Kimi) [missing auth]
    auth=moonshot_api_key model=kimi-k2.5 base_url=https://api.moonshot.cn/v1
* ollama: Ollama [ready]
    auth=openai_api_key model=glm-4.7-flash:q8_0 base_url=http://localhost:11434/v1
```

### GitHub Copilot Format (--api-format copilot)

Use your existing GitHub Copilot subscription as the LLM backend. Authentication uses GitHub's OAuth device flow — no API keys needed.

```
# One-time login (opens browser for GitHub authorization)
oh auth copilot-login

# Then launch with Copilot as the provider
uv run oh --api-format copilot

# Or via environment variable
export OPENHARNESS_API_FORMAT=copilot
uv run oh

# Check auth status
oh auth status

# Remove stored credentials
oh auth copilot-logout
```

| Feature | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Auth method** | GitHub OAuth device flow (no API key needed) |
| **Token management** | Automatic refresh of short-lived session tokens |
| **Enterprise** | Supports GitHub Enterprise via `--github-domain` flag |
| **Models** | Uses Copilot's default model selection |
| **API** | OpenAI-compatible chat completions under the hood |

---

## 🏗️ Harness Architecture

OpenHarness implements the core Agent Harness pattern with 10 subsystems:

```
openharness/
  engine/          # 🧠 Agent Loop — query → stream → tool-call → loop
  tools/           # 🔧 43 Tools — file I/O, shell, search, web, MCP
  skills/          # 📚 Knowledge — on-demand skill loading (.md files)
  plugins/         # 🔌 Extensions — commands, hooks, agents, MCP servers
  permissions/     # 🛡️ Safety — multi-level modes, path rules, command deny
  hooks/           # ⚡ Lifecycle — PreToolUse/PostToolUse event hooks
  commands/        # 💬 54 Commands — /help, /commit, /plan, /resume, ...
  mcp/             # 🌐 MCP — Model Context Protocol client
  memory/          # 🧠 Memory — persistent cross-session knowledge
  tasks/           # 📋 Tasks — background task management
  coordinator/     # 🤝 Multi-Agent — subagent spawning, team coordination
  prompts/         # 📝 Context — system prompt assembly, CLAUDE.md, skills
  config/          # ⚙️ Settings — multi-layer config, migrations
  ui/              # 🖥️ React TUI — backend protocol + frontend
```

### The Agent Loop

The heart of the harness. One loop, endlessly composable:

```
while True:
    response = await api.stream(messages, tools)
    
    if response.stop_reason != "tool_use":
        break  # Model is done
    
    for tool_call in response.tool_uses:
        # Permission check → Hook → Execute → Hook → Result
        result = await harness.execute_tool(tool_call)
    
    messages.append(tool_results)
    # Loop continues — model sees results, decides next action
```

The model decides **what** to do. The harness handles **how** — safely, efficiently, with full observability.

### Harness Flow

- xlsx: Excel operations (from anthropics/skills)
- ... 40+ more
```

**Compatible with [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)** — just copy `.md` files to `~/.openharness/skills/`.

### 🔌 Plugin System

**Compatible with [claude-code plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins)**. Tested with 12 official plugins:

| Plugin | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commit-commands` | Commands | Git commit, push, PR workflows |
| `security-guidance` | Hooks | Security warnings on file edits |
| `hookify` | Commands + Agents | Create custom behavior hooks |
| `feature-dev` | Commands | Feature development workflow |
| `code-review` | Agents | Multi-agent PR review |
| `pr-review-toolkit` | Agents | Specialized PR review agents |

```
# Manage plugins
oh plugin list
oh plugin install <source>
oh plugin enable <name>
```

### 🤝 Ecosystem Workflows

OpenHarness is useful as a lightweight harness layer around Claude-style tooling conventions:

- **OpenClaw-oriented workflows** can reuse Markdown-first knowledge and command-driven collaboration patterns.
- **Claude-style plugins and skills** stay portable because OpenHarness keeps those formats familiar.
- **ClawTeam-style multi-agent work** maps well onto the built-in team, task, and background execution primitives.

For concrete usage ideas instead of generic claims, see [`docs/SHOWCASE.md`](https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/blob/main/docs/SHOWCASE.md).

### 🛡️ Permissions

Multi-level safety with fine-grained control:

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Default** | Ask before write/execute | Daily development |
| **Auto** | Allow everything | Sandboxed environments |
| **Plan Mode** | Block all writes | Large refactors, review first |

**Path-level rules** in `settings.json`:

```
{
  "permission": {
    "mode": "default",
    "path_rules": [{"pattern": "/etc/*", "allow": false}],
    "denied_commands": ["rm -rf /", "DROP TABLE *"]
  }
}
```

### 🖥️ Terminal UI

React/Ink TUI with full interactive experience:

- **Command picker**: Type `/` → arrow keys to select → Enter
- **Permission dialog**: Interactive y/n with tool details
- **Mode switcher**: `/permissions` → select from list
- **Session resume**: `/resume` → pick from history
- **Animated spinner**: Real-time feedback during tool execution
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Shown at the bottom, context-aware

### 📡 CLI

```
oh [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]

Session:     -c/--continue, -r/--resume, -n/--name
Model:       -m/--model, --effort, --max-turns
Output:      -p/--print, --output-format text|json|stream-json
Permissions: --permission-mode, --dangerously-skip-permissions
Context:     -s/--system-prompt, --append-system-prompt, --settings
Advanced:    -d/--debug, --mcp-config, --bare

Subcommands: oh setup | oh provider | oh auth | oh mcp | oh plugin
```

### 🧑💼 ohmo Personal Agent

`ohmo` is a personal-agent app built on top of OpenHarness. It is packaged alongside `oh`, with its own workspace and gateway:

```
# Initialize personal workspace
ohmo init

# Configure gateway channels and pick a provider profile
ohmo config

# Run the personal agent
ohmo

# Run the gateway in foreground
ohmo gateway run

# Check or restart the gateway
ohmo gateway status
ohmo gateway restart
```

Key concepts:

- `~/.ohmo/`
	- personal workspace root
- `soul.md`
	- long-term agent personality and behavior
- `identity.md`
	- who `ohmo` is
- `user.md`
	- user profile and preferences
- `BOOTSTRAP.md`
	- first-run landing ritual
- `memory/`
	- personal memory
- `gateway.json`
	- selected provider profile and channel configuration

`ohmo config` uses the same workflow language as `oh setup`, so you can point the personal-agent gateway at:

- `Anthropic-Compatible API`
- `Claude Subscription`
- `OpenAI-Compatible API`
- `Codex Subscription`
- `GitHub Copilot`

`ohmo init` creates the home workspace once. After that, use `ohmo config` to update provider and channel settings; if the gateway is already running, the config flow can restart it for you.

Currently `ohmo init` / `ohmo config` can guide channel setup for:

- Telegram
- Slack
- Discord
- Feishu

## 🔧 Extending OpenHarness

### Add a Custom Tool

```
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from openharness.tools.base import BaseTool, ToolExecutionContext, ToolResult

class MyToolInput(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(description="Search query")

class MyTool(BaseTool):
    name = "my_tool"
    description = "Does something useful"
    input_model = MyToolInput

    async def execute(self, arguments: MyToolInput, context: ToolExecutionContext) -> ToolResult:
        return ToolResult(output=f"Result for: {arguments.query}")
```

### Add a Custom Skill

Create `~/.openharness/skills/my-skill.md`:

```
---
name: my-skill
description: Expert guidance for my specific domain
---

# My Skill

## When to use
Use when the user asks about [your domain].

## Workflow
1. Step one
2. Step two
...
```

### Add a Plugin

Create `.openharness/plugins/my-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`:

```
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My custom plugin"
}
```

Add commands in `commands/*.md`, hooks in `hooks/hooks.json`, agents in `agents/*.md`.

---

## 🌍 Showcase

OpenHarness is most useful when treated as a small, inspectable harness you can adapt to a real workflow:

- **Repo coding assistant** for reading code, patching files, and running checks locally.
- **Headless scripting tool** for `json` and `stream-json` output in automation flows.
- **Plugin and skill testbed** for experimenting with Claude-style extensions.
- **Multi-agent prototype harness** for task delegation and background execution.
- **Provider comparison sandbox** across Anthropic-compatible backends.

See [`docs/SHOWCASE.md`](https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenHarness/blob/main/docs/SHOWCASE.md) for short, reproducible examples.
